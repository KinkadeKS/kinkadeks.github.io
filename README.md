# Thrive
- We, The Mental Wealth Initiative, hope to help all people, especially today’s teenagers and college students, to become more aware of the importance of their mental health and to connect people who need help with their mental health with the proper resources. 
- Thrive is a tool available to provide people with important information about mental health and a way to reach out anonymously and without stigma. We offer tools such as connecting with professionals, chatting with our AI bot, journaling, creating custom reminders and notifications, and much more. Please give our product a try and help support our communities.
